# My-Pet-Arduino
My-Pet-Arduino Project!
- Turn your Arduino into a friendly pet.
- This project was built with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Board.

How to use:
1) Get the Materials:
- An Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Board
- A power supply for the Arduino
- A device with Google Chrome and Bluetooth enabled
- A computer with Arduino IDE
- (Or one device which has Google Chrome, Bluetooth enabled, and Arduino IDE)
2) Set up:
- Open the Arduino IDE and download:
- Arduino_TensorFlowLite Version 2.4.0-ALPHA Library
- ArduinoBLE Version 1.2.1 Library
- Arduino_LSM9DS1 Version 1.1.0 Library
- Arduino Mbed OS Nano Boards Version 2.2.0 in the Boards Manager
3) Flash the code to the Arduino:
- Download the Arduino folder from this repository, and open it in the Arduino IDE.
- Connect the Arduino to a computer and make sure the correct board and port is selected.
- Upload main.ino to the Arduino Board.
- The code should be running on the Arduino now.
4) Interact with the website:
- On google chrome, go to the link: 3LucasZ.github.io/My-Pet-Arduino/HTML/index.html

How to play:
1) About:
- The Arduino is your new pet! Take care of it well by giving it food, play, cleaning, and sleep. If it is neglected too much, it will disconnect and be very sad.
2) Connect to the Arduino with BLE:
- Click the connect button on the top
- Select your Arduino
- Press pair
3) Take care of the Arduino:
